Media Sorter Readme:

This is my first github repo :) (if you haven't noticed) so I am a bit new to how all this repo and versioning (if that exists on here) and commits and other things so bear with me, I will learn it eventually.

As of now, the Media Sorter runs in the status bar and allows you to perform a manual update of the video files found in the downloads folder. It is able to search through this folder to find your videos, then extract the show name, series number and episode number. It then uses the TVDB API and the library that I created to retrieve the relevant data for that show from theTVDB.com. It doesn't yet allow you to apply the changes to the files, or move them to your preferred location but I will do this soon :)

Also, the code is probably pretty messy at the moment as I've been running into a few hiccups recently with my coding. It is all sorted now (hopefully no bugs :)) but it is probably still in the mess that I left it in.

I also have a feeling that I will be rewriting quite a bit of the JRMedia files to make them more efficient/better but that will become apparent at the time.

If you wish to contribute to this project feel free but I would like to keep this project quite close to myself for the moment, until I have it working a bit better and its a bit older.
I am sort of using this project to help me teach myself quite a bit more about programming in Objective-C and for the Mac whilst I am also programming something else for my 3rd Year Engineering Project. I will release my 3rd year project on github too once it is done, but as you may know this 3rd year project must be my own work only up until it is completed. Anyways, I'm rambling on about something completely off topicâ€¦oops.

If you wish to download the latest stable build I have made then simply download the Media Sorter.app file and run it. You will find it hiding in the status bar with the big long name "Media Sorter".

Thanks :)
